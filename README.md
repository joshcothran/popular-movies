# Popular Movies

## Objective
Create a page that displays a grid of popular movies as demonstrated in the mock below:

<img src="/public/mockup.gif?raw=true" width="400px">

 ## Requirements
1. Display a grid of posters for popular movies
    * Be sure to include the movieâ€™s title somewhere on the card
2. On hover, the poster should scale and be highlighted (as shown in the mock)
3. The grid should be infinitely scrollable, with additional posters paging in as the user
scrolls down
4. While waiting for the API, a loading indicator should be displayed
    * Operational API errors should be addressed and communicated to the user
5. New posters should animate when they page in, fading in and scaling
The page should be deployed and accessible from a public IP address or URL. DNS is not important (i.e., auto-generated URLs from Amazon, Heroku, etc. are fine).

Code should be unit tested.

## Data
Movie data is openly available from  https://www.themoviedb.org . Sign up for an API key and use their popular movie endpoint.
